# Kraken - shiny app for job, invoice, customer and employee reporting

## Development

To contribute to the package functionality, Gitlab is recommended - create your branch and submit a merge request. 

The `devtools::load_all` function roughly simulates what happens when the package is installed and loaded with library:

```r
devtools::load_all()
```

Use the command below to launch the app:

```r
runKraken()
```
